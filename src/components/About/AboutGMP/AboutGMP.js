            Gayathri Maha Purascharana requires 6850 Gayathri Jaap every day or 24 Lakh Gayathri Jaap 
            each year for 24 years. This maha yagna requires Akhanda Deepa, Akhanda Dhuni, Nitya 
            Agnihotra and Akhanda Brahmacharya. The sadhaka also must be on Eka Vastra (single cloth). 
            The Sadhaka also must follow strict food habits. Whole wheat must be fed to a cow and from the 
            cow dung, whole wheat must be collected, made into flour and eat the roti (Indian bread) made 
            from that flour. Otherwise, the Sadhaka must take cow milk. This must be continued for the 
            entire duration of 24 years. On every full moon day (Pournami), the Sadhaka can take food 
            prepared by devotees. The devotees must do a 41 day or 21 day anushthana (ceremony) at home by 
            carrying out Gayathri Jaap at home with rice with one rice seed for each Gayathri Mantra. 
            Then, on full moon day, the rice collected thus must be cooked and 1/4th part each of the rice 
            must be offered to Gayathri Mata as Naivedyam, Akhanda Dhuni, Nitya Agnihotra and remaining 1/4th 
            only must be offered to Swamyji as meals.

            Swamyji lives in a serene Ashram in the jungles around Narasimharao Palem village of 
            Veerullapadu mandal in Krishna District. This is situated exactly 50km away from 
            Kanakadurga temple of Vijayawada. Swamyji started this Maha Yagna on January 22nd, 2018 
            on the auspicious day of
            <div className={classes.WideText}> Vasanta Panchami. On that day, Akhanda Dhuni was brought from 
            Ekkiralla Bharadwaja Master's Dhuni which was given to Master by Sai Baba himself. 
            The dhuni at the Agastya Ashram was started by Avadhuta Polaiah Swamyji. The Akhanda 
            Deepa was lighted by Mata Preeti (Veda Mata). Mata Gayathri idol Pratishthapan was also 
            done as per Mata Preeti's directions. From that day, Swamyji lives in this ashram. His aim 
            in conducting this Maha Yagna is world peace and prosperity. This yagna brings peace to nature 
            and thereby helps the world achieve peace. Since Swamyji's guruji ordered him to do Akhanda 
            Gayathri Maha Purascharana, after Swamy Sugunanda Gayathri completes this maha yagam, his son 
            will do it and this tradition is to be continued for generations to come.

            <h4>Who has done it before Swamy Sugunanda Gayathri?</h4>

            Gayathri Maha Purascharana is described in the 11th chapter of Sri Devi Bhagavatam. This yagna was
            conducted by Gautama Maharishi when there was a severe drought. One year after he started this 
            Maha Yagna, rains blessed the country and brought good fortune from the resultant good crops. 
            Vishwamitra Mahamuni also conducted this maha yagna with 32 lakh Gayathri Jaap and created 
            Trishanku Swarga. In the recent memory, Veda Murthy, Tapo Nishtha, Yuga Drashta Pandit 
            Srirama Sarma Acharya conducted this maha yagna at Santikunj, Haridwar. After this, 
            only Swamy Sugunanda Gayathri is conducting this maha yagna in Southern India.

            <h4>What is the significance of doing this maha yagna with Gayathri Mantra?</h4>

           Gayathri Mantra's root is the Sanskrit word Gayi. This means Prana. Gayathri Mantra is 
           prana swarupa mantra. This mantra has 24 letters. This whole world is created with Pancha Bhoota 
           (5 elements) and 24 tattvas. Our body is also made of Pancha Bhoota. Gayathri Mantra is made up of 
           24 letters.  This is why Gayathri Mantra is known as prana swarupa mantra. In the Sankhya 
           Sastra written by Kapila Maharishi, the following explanation of Pancha Bhoota and 24 Tattvas is 
           given:

           <ol>
            <li>
            At first, the sky (Akasa) formed. The four tattvas of Akasa, known as Antahkarana Chaturthi, are Manaha (Heart), 
            Buddhi (intelligence), Chitta (mind), and Ahankara (ego).
           </li>

          <li>
          Second came air (Vayu). The tattvas associated with Vayu are five - Vyana, Udana, Prana, 
          Apana, and Samana vayu. These are also known as Pancha Prana.
          </li>

          <li>
          Next came fire (Agni). The tattvas that took root in Agni are Gyanendriyas - Netra (eye), 
          Charma (skin), Jihva (tongue), Karna (ear), and Nasika (nose).
          </li>
            
            <li>
            Next came water (Jala). Five Pancha Tanmatras took root in water. Those are Rasa, Sabda, Sparsa, 
            Rupa, and Gandha.
            </li>

            <li>
            Next came earth (Prithvi). Five Karmendriyas took root in this element - Guda Sthana (Anus), Hasta 
           (hands), Pada (legs), Vak (speech), and Jananendriya (reproductive organs).
            </li>
           </ol>

        Since the Gayathri Mantra is the Prana Swarupa made up of 24 letters symbolizing the 24 
        tattvas, human body is made up of the pancha bhoota and the 24 tattvas and the whole world and 
        all life is made up of the same pancha bhoota and 24 tattvas, Gayathri Maha Purascharana will 
        bring world peace and wellness for not only humans but all life forms.
